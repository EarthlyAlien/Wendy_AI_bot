PyAudio has to be installed from wheel to avoid version dependency errors.

You can find the wheels here:

And since, newscatcher package only works for Python 3.7 and above, the minimal requirement to run this program is to have Python 3.7 or above versions installed.

Chromedriver.exe is also version specific which depends on current chrome version you are using for browser automation.
