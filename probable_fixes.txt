1. PyAudio has to be installed from wheel to avoid version dependency errors.

    You can find the wheels here: 
    https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

    I have added "PyAudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl" since I am using Python 3.8 in 64-bit system.
    Command to install it is: python -m pip install "path_of_the_downloaded_wheel" which is in my case -> python -m pip install "C:\Users\Chaitanya V\Downloads\Wendy_AI_bot\PyAudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl"

2. Newscatcher package only works for Python 3.7 and above, the minimal requirement to run this program is to have Python 3.7 or above versions installed.

3. Chromedriver.exe is also version specific which depends on current chrome version you are using for browser automation.
Find it here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

4. VLC Media Player must be installed and it's dll path should be added to .py file to make sure python-vlc package works fine.
