# Wendy_AI_bot


Introduction

With the evolution in AI and the current capabilities of smart technology devices like, smart speakers(Alexa), smart phones(Siri, Google), and smart T.V's, smart Cars and smart homes are paving the way for future. I have designed “Wendy”, a speech bot computer system similar to Alexa and Jarvis which manages the voice commands provided and makes all works Through the Artificial Intelligence (A.I) integrated into python software making all things handy just through simple voice commands .In addition, it is aimed in providing all the information a financial analyst needs about a company and the market analysis to make decision about investments and mitigating risks as well as benefitting profits. The ultimate goal is that grant user an easy, beneficial way to interact with the technology they use every day. It's all driven help make one’s life, much better



Inspired by many AI based applications like SIRI, JARVIS, ALEXA and through rigorous learning on python and AI in Fintech Academy, I have planned to create my very own Voice Interactive virtual AI bot, an extension for chatbot, that performs all the actions that one does in one’s daily life.   



OVERVIEW ON PYTHON SPEECH RECOGNITION:
Speech is the most common means of communication around the world. Most of the population in the world relies on speech to communicate with each other. Suppose we are building a model and instead of a written approach we want our system to respond to speech, it becomes fairly difficult and requires a lot of data to be processed. A speech recognition system overcomes this barrier by translating speech to text.
Speech recognition system basically translates the spoken utterances to text. There are various real-life examples of speech recognition system. For example- siri, which takes the speech as input and translates it into text.
The advantage of using a speech recognition system is that it overcomes the barrier of literacy. A speech recognition model can serve both literate and illiterate audience as well, since it focuses on spoken utterances.



Applications:
 Wendy can now help you with
1)	Welcome: When this application is initialized it responds as “Hello there with the status as Good morning, afternoon or evening basing on the time. The python code is made in such a way that it fetches the current time and responds accordingly. And then asks for the request “How it can help?”
2)	Wikipedia:  Mention what you would like to search with the phrase Wikipedia and Wendy does it for you and replies the information it found
3)	Headlines: The python code is programmed in such a way that if it receives the variable “headlines” it collects all the top headlines through the search engine and responds back reading the headlines for you.
4)	Browse Youtube: Wendy, if it receives the command as “youtube”, it responds saying “What Can I search for you” and searches for command ordered by the user. If nothing is found on the command it responds as “result not found”.  This search engine is executed by using selenium.
